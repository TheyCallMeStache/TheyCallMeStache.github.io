Welcome! I am a new sysadmin who has decided that I needed to keep track of what I was working on so I could
reference it when I eventually forget. I hope you find osme use out of any of the information I post here.

My Current Interests/Goals :
  - Powershell
  - Windows Administration (AD DS, WSUS, SCCM, WDS, MDT , etc)
  - Red Had Linux Administration
  - Automation
  - Infrastructure as Code

Feel free to reach out and get in touch.
